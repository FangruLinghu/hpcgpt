# Inference Scripts

This directory contains inference scripts used during the evaluation phase of our experiments.

## Directory Structure

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific method or experimental setup. Within each subfolder, you will find:

- `eval_chatbot.py`: The inference script used to evaluate the method.
- `*.slurm`: A SLURM job submission script for running the evaluation on a cluster environment.
